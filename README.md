    Hello I am David Alberghini, I am currently attending a Data Visualization Bootcamp at the University of Denver. In the last three months I went from zero coding experience to having a very solid grasp on the following languages and modules:
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft Excel</li>
      <li>VBA</li>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
      <li>Pandas</li>
      <li>Matplotlib</li>
      <li>APIs</li>
      <li>SQL</li>
      <li>SQL Alchemy</li>
      <li>HTML</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    I am currently employed at United Natural Foods Inc, which is a natural and organic wholesale food distributer. Our largest customer nationally is Whole Foods. I am a receiving superviosr there, but am currently in charge of training for our upcoming system conversion. We have been in the process of moving our warehouse systems from a DOS based program to something a little more modern. As a company we have been working on this project since 2010.
    I have assisted in the training or implemenation of this new system in the following locations:
    <ol>
      <li>Lancaster, TX</li>
      <li>Dayville, CT</li>
      <li>Howell, NJ</li>
      <li>Atlanta, GA</li>
      <li>Chesterfield, NH</li>
      <li>Moreno Valley, CA</li>
      <li>Aurora, CO (pending)</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>Overall I have been looking for a change in both scenery and career, hence the Data Visualization Bootcamp. My previous schooling is three years at the University of Connecticut, where I studied Chemistry as a major, with a planned Math minor. I left UConn in the fall of 2009, to persue actual life experience, which I had none of. While away I gained some perspective that can be best summed up with the following quote.
    "Are you committed or are you just interested?"<br>
    This is from former head football coach of the Kansas City Cheifs, Herm Edwards. <br>
    As it turns out I was just interested in Chemistry and did not know how to be committed. Ten years later I can see that difference and am committed to paving a new career path for myself.
